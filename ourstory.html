            <p>Precision farming is a farming management strategy that focuses on identifying and responding to field variations. Precision agriculture is a technique employed by Terra Agri Farms East Africa to enhance productivity, quality, and output by optimising inputs such as water and fertiliser</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-text">
            <p>Our farms benefit from increased output and reduced plant waste due to the correct use of pesticides. Due to soil variances, photosynthetic penetration levels, and geography. we are rigorous and exact in the manner we monitor flat, valley, inclined, or flooded land. We employ precision farming technology and practises to tackle environmental concerns, which today have a greater environmental, economic, and social impact. From an email proposing which equipment to use, tractor specs, to engineers developing applications using satellite images, GPS information technology, or GIS technologies, technology plays a critical part in the operation management and information systems of our farms</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-text">
            <p>This indicates that we are more precise in identifying danger areas, soil temperatures, and other environmental conditions, and that we can respond early to maintain crop production. When it comes to planting, fertilising, and harvesting, our equipment is more exact
                We can generate up to six times more yield per hectare than a normal farm utilising current technologies such as satellite photos, GPS, and geographic information systems, and this is reinforced by remote sensing photography of our farm fields, which indicates the difference in outputs
